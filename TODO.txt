Before 0.2 release:
 * document needed templates
 * put 'inactive-users' named-URLconf into a namespace (maybe)
 * update to latest releases of django and django-registration

After 0.2 release:
 * make 'inactive-users' URLconf name cfgable?
 * add a 'resend confirmation email or change email' view ala opencore
 * tests!
